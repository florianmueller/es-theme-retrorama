# es-theme-retrorama-4-3 - the 4:3 version

This is a modified version of the original [Retrorama by Phill's Doodle's](https://github.com/lipebello/es-theme-retrorama) and the forked [Attract Mode convert theme by matteocedroni](https://github.com/matteocedroni/am-theme-retrorama).
This project is there to start converting the great work of Phill and Matteo to bring a proper Retrorama 4:3 version for RetroPie EmulationStation to life!
All work in progress!

# In loving memory of Stan Lee. A true inspiration and without his legacy, this theme won't be so nostalgic. Rest in peace...

Thank you all! I hope you enjoy this theme
