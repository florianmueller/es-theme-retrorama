# es-theme-retrorama-4-3 - the 4:3 version

This is a modified version of the original Retrorama by Phill's Doodle's and the forked Attract Mode convert theme by matteocedroni.
This project is there to start converting the great work of Phill and Matteo to bring a proper Retrorama 4:3 version for RetroPie EmulationStation to life!
All work in progress!

# In loving memory of Stan Lee. A true inspiration and without his legacy, this theme won't be so nostalgic. Rest in peace...

Thank you all! I hope you enjoy this theme
